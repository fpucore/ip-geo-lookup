# 🌐 IP Geolocation Lookup Tool

A **graphical IP geolocation tool for Linux terminals**, written in **Perl** and designed for **kitty-based terminal consoles**.

It detects your public IP address, resolves its country via GeoIP, draws the location on a world map, and renders everything **directly inside the terminal**.

Intended for **Cherry Terminal** on GNU Operating System / H-Linux platform and the **Blackbox-hwm** workspace, but is usable on any Linux system with the required dependencies satisfied.

## ✨ Features

* **IP Detection** – Fetches your public IP using `icanhazip.com`
* **Geolocation Lookup** – Resolves country data via `geoiplookup`
* **Caching** – Avoids repeated lookups by caching results locally
* **Graphical World Map** – Downloads a world map, pins your location with a red marker, and renders it in-terminal
* **Robust Error Handling** – Graceful fallbacks when services or tools are unavailable
* **Customizable** – Easily extend country centroids or replace the map source
